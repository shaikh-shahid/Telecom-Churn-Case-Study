Description
Problem Statement
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn.


Goal
Predict if a customer will churn, given the ~170 columns containing customer behavior, usage patterns, payment patterns, and other features that might be relevant. Your target variable is "churn_probability"

## Conclusions

* Telecom company needs to pay attention to the roaming rates. They need to provide good offers to the customers who are using services from a roaming zone to retain them for longer periods.
* The company needs to focus on the STD and ISD rates. Either the rates are too high or competitions is providing better rates. Our suggestion is to provide customers with some kind of STD and ISD packages.
